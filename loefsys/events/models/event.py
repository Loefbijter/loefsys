"""In this module, the models for events are defined.

Two types of events exist. Events with mandatory registration are defined by
:class:`.RequiredRegistrationEvent` and events with optional registration are defined by
:class:`.OptionalRegistrationEvent`. Loefbijter currently does not organize any
activities with optional registration, so it is possible that this model gets deleted in
the future.
